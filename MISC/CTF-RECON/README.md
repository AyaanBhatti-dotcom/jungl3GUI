# 🎮 CTF-RECON
**A retro SNES-themed recon tool that combines Gobuster and Nmap into one streamlined command-line interface.**
Perfect for CTFs, HTB/THM rooms, and rapid enumeration under pressure.
## 🧰 What is CTF-RECON?

All wrapped in an 8-bit inspired retro aesthetic.
## ✨ Features

- Saves output for later review
- Lightweight and terminal-based
